                <h1>Web Designer in Galway</h1><br>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Laura from Galway.<br><br>

                        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Law and IT, and a Master's in Digital Media from NUIG. My creative journey spans various art forms, including painting, charcoal, sculpture, and batik.<br><br> 
                        
                        In recent years, my work has evolved to focus primarily on digital works, where I continue to explore and develop my skills.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2><br>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>My artistic expression started out in the beginning with the traditional pencil and paper. I developed these as I got older and as my skills expanded, I was fortunate enough to be part of the Berlin Wall jigsaw remembrance. My school was among those chosen to take part in this remembrance and it results in an artwork of mine featuring in the German Ambassadorâ€™s house in Dublin.<br><br>

                    During college I helped support myself by working on a commission basis, designing emotes and badges for Twitch streamers. This allowed me to expand my digital drawing skills and creativity. I have a particular interest in the areas of graphic design, including logo design, photo editing and the aforementioned digital drawing.</p>
